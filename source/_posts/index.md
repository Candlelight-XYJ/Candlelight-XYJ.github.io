## Short bio
Hi! This is Yujia Xiang.

I am currently attending a master at Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research interests are system biology and data visualization. My goal is to integrate these multi-omics data and construct interactions between entries, using math and computational method to explore the disease-associated molecular mechanism. By using visualization analysis method, the big biological data will tell us a fantastic story.  

Recently, I'm focusing on these topics related projects:
+ single-cell omics
+ metabolomics
+ small rna seq, especially ce-rna network

Outside of programming, I enjoy travelling(You could see these photos in the `Gallery` menu), DouDiZhu(A famous chinese poker game) and QQ Speed
