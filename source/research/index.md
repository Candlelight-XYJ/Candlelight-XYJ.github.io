## Research Interests

#### Network Biology/System Biology applied in biological big data

Network is a good method to model biology system, My goal is to integrate these multi-omics data and construct interactions between entries, using math and computational method to explore the disease-associated molecular mechanism

#### Bioinformatics software and algorithm development


#### Visual Analytics in Biological data
